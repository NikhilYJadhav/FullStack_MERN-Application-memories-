Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I have built a Full Stack MERN Project - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media MERN application that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.


In This, you will find CLient as frontend which is React and Server as backend which is Nodejs.
The whole complete project is built on vscode. 

After the success of the application on the local port, I push data on GitHub through Git function through commands.

git init
git add . 
git commit -m "Add existing project files to Git"
git remote add origin


Lastly, I deployed the server on Render https://dashboard.render.com/ and the client on https://vercel.com/nikhilyjadhavs-projects.

Hurray ðŸŽ‰ The Application is Live at "https://memories-phi-six.vercel.app/" Do Check it out.
